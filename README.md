> [!WARNING]
> This next command may need to be run as admin/root depending on your system, and you may need to close and reopen your terminal for pnpm to be in your PATH.
```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you aren't using an admin/root terminal from here onwards. It will mess up your Discord/venco instance and you will most likely have to reinstall.
